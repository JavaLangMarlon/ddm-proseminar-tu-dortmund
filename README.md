This repository contains all relevant files for my presentation and report on the paper "Directional diffusion models for graph representation learning" by Yang et al. (2023).

## Summary of the paper

Diffusion models have become a success story in the domain of image synthesis. However, they have not been used for graph representation learning yet.

By introducing Directional Noise and Directional Diffusion Models, Yang et al. introduce a diffusion model that fills this gap and provide promising benchmark results.

Considering themselves pioneers in the field of exploring the isotropic structure of graphs, their paper creates a significant research perspective in graph learning.
